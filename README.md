# recipe-recommender-system
A research paper reporting on the results of a recommender system.

I perform an exploratory analysis of the data in a recipe dataset. I describe the
dataset, including its basic statistics and properties, and report any interesting findings. This
exploratory analysis motivates the design of the recommender system model.

I describe literature related to the problem being studied. 

I describe my results and conclusions and the significance of the results.
